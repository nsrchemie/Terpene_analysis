./HMDB01060.xml:  <description>Ubiquinol 8 is a ubiquinol in which the polyprenyl substituent is octaprenyl. Ubiquinol-8 is the reduced form of Ubiquinone-8. Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in membranes. In eukaryotes ubiquinone is found mostly within the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions in respiratory electron transport, transferring two electrons from either complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) to complex III (bc1 complex). The quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from 4-hydroxybenzoate, while the isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, which feeds isoprene units into the Polyprenyl Biosynthesis pathways. The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain vary in different species. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has 6 such subunits, Escherichia coli K-12 has 8, rat and mouse have 9, and Homo sapiens has 10. Ubiquinol-8 is effective as an anti-oxidant. By donating one of its hydrogen atoms to become the free-radical semiquinone (.Q-), it can neutralize a lipid peroxyl radical. The free-radical semiquinone is then restored to a non-free-radical state by the respiratory chain Q cycle. ubiquinol or the free-radical semiquinone can also regenerate the Vitamin E tocopheroxyl radical by electron donation (http://www.benbest.com/nutrceut/CoEnzymeQ.html).</description>

Geranyl diphosphate is regarded as a key intermediate in the steroid, isoprene and terpene biosynthesis pathways and is used by organisms in the biosynthesis of farnesyl pyrophosphate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, cholesterol, terpenes and terpenoids. (wikipedia). In humans, geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to form geranyl diphosphate. Animals produce IPP through the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Isoprenoid compounds have been implicated in several human disease states including coronary heart disease, blindness, infectious hepatitis and cancer. Geranyl pyrophosphate is an intermediate in the HMG-CoA reductase pathway used by organisms in the biosynthesis of terpenes and terpenoids. -- Wikipedia.</description>

./HMDB02012.xml:  <description>Ubiquinone-1 is a member of the chemical class known as Polyprenylbenzoquinones. These are compounds containing a polyisoprene chain attached to a quinone at the second ring position. Ubiquione-1 has just 1 isoprene unit. Normally in humans it has 10. Ubiquinone-1 is an intermediate in the synthesis of Ubiquionone 10, which is also called Coenzyme Q (CoQ). CoQ is found in the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, lysosomes, vesicles and notably the inner membrane of the mitochondrion where it is an important part of the electron transport chain; there it passes reducing equivalents to acceptors such as Coenzyme Q : cytochrome c - oxidoreductase. CoQ is also essential in the formation of the apoptosome along with other adapter proteins. The loss of trophic factors activates pro-apoptotic enzymes, causing the breakdown of mitochondria. Because of its ability to transfer electrons and therefore act as an antioxidant, Coenzyme Q has become a valued dietary supplement. CoQ10 has been widely used for the treatment of heart disease (especially heart failure), gum diseases, and also breast cancer. The benzoquinone portion of Coenzyme Q10 is synthesized from amino acids, while the isoprene sidechain is synthesized from acetyl CoA through the mevalonate pathway. The mevalonate pathway is used for the first steps of cholesterol biosynthesis.</description>

Vitamin K is a family of phylloquinones that contains a ring of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone and an isoprenoid side chain. Several forms of vitamin K have been identified: vitamin K 1 (vitamin K 1) derived from plants, vitamin K 2 (menaquinone) from bacteria, and synthetic naphthoquinone provitamins, vitamin K 3 (menadione). Vitamin K1 has only one double bond on the proximal isoprene unit. Vitamin K1 possesses the same type and degree of activity as does naturally-occurring vitamin K, which is necessary for the production via the liver of active prothrombin (factor II), proconvertin (factor VII), plasma thromboplastin component (factor IX), and Stuart factor (factor X). Rich sources of vitamin K 1 include green plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria. Vitamin K1 has antihemorrhagic and prothrombogenic activity. Vitamin K1 is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stable to air and moisture but decomposes in sunlight. It is found naturally in a wide variety of green plants.</description>

./HMDB04305.xml:  <description>Farnesol is a signaling molecule that is derived from farnesyl diphosphate, an intermediate in the isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Farnesol is a 15 carbon isoprenoid alcohol is the corresponding dephosphorylated form of the isoprenoid farnesyl diphosphate. Farnesol has a potential role in controlling the degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase (EC 1.1.1.34, NADPH-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase). The enzyme is stabilized under conditions of cellular sterol depletion (e.g. statin-treated cells) and rapidly degraded in sterol-loaded cells. In mammalian cells, this enhanced degradation is dependent on the presence of both a sterol and a non-sterol derived from the isoprenoid pathway; farnesol, the dephosphorylated form of farnesyl diphosphate, can function as the non-sterol component. Farnesol has been shown to activate the farnesoid receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor that forms a functional heterodimer with RXR. Thus, dephosphorylation of farnesyl diphosphate, an intermediate in the cholesterol synthetic pathway, might produce an active ligand for the FXR:RXR heterodimer. The physiological ligand for FXR remains to be identified; farnesol, may simply mimic the unidentified natural ligand(s). In addition, exogenous farnesol have an effect on several other physiological processes, including inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell cycle progression and actin cytoskeletal disorganization. Farnesol cellular availability is an important determinant of vascular tone in animals and humans, and provides a basis for exploring farnesyl metabolism in humans with compromised vascular function as well as for using farnesyl analogues as regulators of arterial tone in vivo. A possible metabolic fate for farnesol is its conversion to farnesoic acid, and then to farnesol-derived dicarboxylic acids (FDDCAs) which would then be excreted in the urine. Farnesol can also be oxidized to a prenyl aldehyde, presumably by an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and that this activity resides in the mitochondrial and peroxisomal. Liver Endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomal fractions are able to phosphorylate farnesol to Farnesyl diphosphate in a Cytosine triphosphate dependent fashion. (PMID: 9812197, 8636420, 9083051, 9015362). Prenol is polymerized by dehydration reactions; when there are at least four isoprene units (n in the above formula is greater than or equal to four), the polymer is called a polyprenol. Polyprenols can contain up to 100 isoprene units (n=100) linked end to end with the hydroxyl group (-OH) remaining at the end. These isoprenoid alcohols are also called terpenols These isoprenoid alcohols are important in the acylation of proteins, carotenoids, and fat-soluble vitamins A, E and K. They are also building blocks for plant oils such as farnesol and geraniol. Prenol is also a building block of cholesterol (built from six isoprene units), and thus of all steroids. Prenol has sedative properities, it is probably GABA receptor allosteric modulator.When the isoprene unit attached to the alcohol is saturated, the compound is referred to as a dolichol. Dolichols are important as glycosyl carriers in the synthesis of polysaccharides.(Wikipedia).</description>

Terpenes are derived biosynthetically from units of isoprene, which has the molecular formula C5H8. The basic molecular formulas of terpenes are multiples of that, (C5H8)n where n is the number of linked isoprene units. This is called the isoprene rule or the C5 rule. The isoprene units may be linked together "head to tail" to form linear chains or they may can be arranged to form rings.

./HMDB05176.xml:  <description>Dolichols are polyisoprenic molecule ubiquitously present in the lipid fraction of animal and plant tissues, discovered 40 years ago during experiments on the biosynthesis of ubiquinone. The molecular structure of dolichol comprises a sequence of unsaturated isoprenic units bearing a primary terminal hydroxyl group. The length of dolichyl chains depends on the species of the organism from which they are isolated. Mammalian dolichol generally is made up of 16 to 23 unsaturated isoprene units, and the terminal hydroxyl group may exist either free or esterified with fatty acids, phosphoric acid, and pyrophosphoric acid. In biological membranes, this linear polyisoprenoid compound may be located between the two leaflets of the lipid bilayer, close to the free end of the phospholipid fatty acid molecules. Metabolism and function of dolichol were largely unknown until recently. Synthesis of dolichol by the mevalonate pathway was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in many tissues. The isoprenoid pyrophosphate intermediates are shared by the cholesterol, dolichol, and ubiquinone pathways, and treatment with drugs that block hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase may significantly decrease their plasma and tissue levels. In humans, there is no apparent positive correlation between serum dolichol and tissue dolichol and age. In view of the total content of the body, half life of the total body dolichol, and dolichol content in the extracellular space, it was concluded that the dolichol in tissues probably derives from biosynthesis in those tissues and that relocation of dolichol via circulation cannot be prominent in vivo. The levels of dolichol in human serum have apparently no correlation to age or serum total cholesterol, and exhibit a linear correlation to high density lipoprotein cholesterols which may reflect the fact that the dolichols are associated with the high-density lipoprotein fraction. No enzymic pathways for dolichol degradation were described, but no case of dolichol-storage disease was reported. Shrinkage of tissue because of increased lysosomal degradation in the process of atrophy does not affect the dolichol content and concentration increases. Small quantities of dolichol that may be excreted into the urine at least in part is derived from the lysosomes of the excretory organ, and serum dolichol levels may be elevated in chronic cholestatic liver diseases. Recent evidence shows that phagocytosis may cause the degradation and disposal of the engulfed dolichol, possibly because of nonenzymatic free radical mediated decomposition. By means of a 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analytical method, the hypothesis was substantiated that dolichol may act as a free-radical scavenger in the cell membranes and protect polyunsaturated fatty acids from peroxidation, and that it may undergo decomposition in the process.

./HMDB06353.xml:  <description>Dolichol phosphate is the most prevalent polyisoprenyl-glycosyl carrier found in mammals. It is involved in reactions such as the C-4 and O-mannosylation of proteins, the formation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors and the N-glycosylation of proteins. The chain length of eukaryotic dolichol molecules differs from 14 to 17 isoprene units in unicellular organisms like yeast whereas mammalian cells produce dolichol with 18-21 isoprene units. During the de novo synthesis of dolichol in eukaryotes, farnesyl pyrophosphate, a metabolite of cholesterol biosynthesis, is elongated by successive condensations to isopentenyl pyrophosphate molecules. These reactions are catalyzed by cis-isopentenyltransferases. After the polyisoprene pyrophosphate chain has reached its final length, both phosphate residues are released by mono- or pyrophosphatases. The isoprene unit of the polyprenol is then reduced by a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent microsomal reductase. The final step in dolichol phosphate synthesis is catalyzed by dolichol kinase (DK1), an enzyme that transfers a phosphate from choline-phosphate cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to dolichol. Once synthesized, dolichol phosphate can react with cytosolic GDP-mannose in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form dolichyl phosphate D-mannose. A new inherited metabolic disorder, Dolichol kinase (DK1) deficiency has recently been discovered. Affected patients present with a very severe clinical phenotype, with death in early infancy. Symptoms include secondary microencephaly, dry, thin, parchmentlike skin, hyperkeratosis, minimal hair growth and muscular hypotonia. (PMID: 17273964).</description>

./HMDB06709.xml:  <description>Ubiquinone-2 is a member of the chemical class known as Polyprenylbenzoquinones. These are compounds containing a polyisoprene chain attached to a quinone at the second ring position. Ubiquione-2 has just 2 isoprene units. Normally in humans it has 10. Ubiquinone-2 is an intermediate in the synthesis of Ubiquionone 10. Ubiquionone is involved in cellular respiration. It is fat-soluble and is therefore mobile in cellular membranes; it plays a unique role in the electron transport chain (ETC). In the inner bacterial membrane, electrons from NADH and succinate pass through the ETC to the oxygen, which is then reduced to water. The transfer of electrons through ETC results in the pumping of H+ across the membrane creating a proton gradient across the membrane, which is used by ATP synthase (located on the membrane) to generate ATP.</description>

./HMDB06710.xml:  <description>Ubiquinone-4 is a member of the chemical class known as Polyprenylbenzoquinones. These are compounds containing a polyisoprene chain attached to a quinone at the second ring position. Ubiquione-4 has just 4 isoprene units. Normally in humans it has 10 (CoQ10). Ubiquinone-4 is an intermediate in the synthesis of Ubiquionone 10. Ubiquinone-4 is a Coenzyme Q analogue that have been identified in brain. Based on the isoprenoid moiety, the presence of various coenzyme Q homologues in prokaryotes and eurkaryotes has been confirmed, and these homologues are classified as Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11, and Q12. The numbers, Qn, refer to the number of isoprenoid units attached at the 6- position on the benzoquinone ring of the coenzyme Q moiety. (PMID: 12064350) Coenzyme Q is the only type of Quinone naturally found in animals (other quinones such as vitamin K is provided by foods). Coenzyme Q is a fat-soluble and amphipathic compound that is the integral component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. It is ubiquitous in nature and is found in subcellular organelles, serum lipoproteins, blood plasma, urine, and feces. Ubiquinones are amphipathic because of the benzoquinone ring (hydrophilic) and the polyisoprenoid side chain moiety (lipophilic). The primary role of coenzyme Q is to transfer electrons between redox components of the electron transport chain, to create a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and drive ATP formation. Additional functions of coenzyme Q are to influence membrane fluidity; to recycle the radical forms of vitamin C and E; and, most important, to act as a lipid antioxidant protecting membrane phospholipids against peroxidation. Coenzyme Q is the only endogenously occurring lipid-soluble antioxidant that occurs ubiquitously and can be synthesized in all organisms.</description>

./HMDB11661.xml:  <description>2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol (DMQH2) is an intermediate in coenzyme Q biosynthesis. It is produced by gut microbes. In microbes, the starting compound, 4-hydroxybenzoate, undergoes a prenylation, a decarboxylation and three hydroxylations alternating with three methylation reactions, resulting in the formation of coenzyme Q. In the final step, DMQH2 is converted from 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol (DDMQH2) with the help of Methyltransferase. Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone or Q) is a redox active lipid containing a long polyprenyl tail attached to a fully substituted benzoquinone ring. The number (n) of isoprene units in the polyprenyl tail (Qn) is distinct in different organisms; humans produce Q10, Caenorhabditis elegans Q9, Escherichia coli Q8, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Q6.</description>

./HMDB11678.xml:  <description>Geranylgeranylcysteine is a modified thioether amino acid in which an isoprenyl group (geranylgeranyl) has been attached to the sulfhydryl group of cysteine through a thioether bond. Geranylgeranylcysteine is typically formed through posttranslational (prenylation) protein modification whereupon degradation of the parent protein leaves the modified (prenylated) amino acid. Prenylation is a relatively recently discovered post-translational modification of proteins that directs cytosollic proteins to membranes while at the same time activating them functionally. The change in hydrophobicity that is essential for membrane binding is done via the covalent attachment of a polyisoprene (such as a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl group) to a C-terminal cysteine by a thioether bond. Prenylated proteins can comprise up to 2% of total cellular protein. Prenylcysteine lyase is an enzyme that is capable of cleaving the thiother bond in prenylcysteines and is used to help in the turnover of prenylated proteins. Prenylcysteine lyase deficiency leads to the accumulation of farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine in brain and liver. (PMID: 9287348).</description>

./HMDB14869.xml:  <description>Nateglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naive to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Nateglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine (83%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites possess less activity than the parent compound. One minor metabolite, the isoprene, has the same potency as its parent compound. </description>

./HMDB36062.xml:  <description>Ubiquinone-6 is a member of the chemical class known as Polyprenylbenzoquinones. These are compounds containing a polyisoprene chain attached to a quinone at the second ring position. Ubiquione-6 has just 6 isoprene units. Normally in humans it has 10. Ubiquinone-6 is an intermediate in the synthesis of Ubiquionone 10. It is an endogenouse compound but it has also been isolated from foods containing baker's yeast. Ubiquionone 10 (CoQ10) is involved in cellular respiration. It is fat-soluble and is therefore mobile in cellular membranes; it plays a unique role in the electron transport chain (ETC). In the inner bacterial membrane, electrons from NADH and succinate pass through the ETC to the oxygen, which is then reduced to water. The transfer of electrons through ETC results in the pumping of H+ across the membrane creating a proton gradient across the membrane, which is used by ATP synthase (located on the membrane) to generate ATP.</description>

./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Ubiquinol 8 is a ubiquinol in which the polyprenyl substituent is octaprenyl. Ubiquinol-8 is the reduced form of Ubiquinone-8. Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in membranes. In eukaryotes ubiquinone is found mostly within the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions in respiratory electron transport, transferring two electrons from either complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) to complex III (bc1 complex). The quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from 4-hydroxybenzoate, while the isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, which feeds isoprene units into the Polyprenyl Biosynthesis pathways. The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain vary in different species. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has 6 such subunits, Escherichia coli K-12 has 8, rat and mouse have 9, and Homo sapiens has 10. Ubiquinol-8 is effective as an anti-oxidant. By donating one of its hydrogen atoms to become the free-radical semiquinone (.Q-), it can neutralize a lipid peroxyl radical. The free-radical semiquinone is then restored to a non-free-radical state by the respiratory chain Q cycle. ubiquinol or the free-radical semiquinone can also regenerate the Vitamin E tocopheroxyl radical by electron donation (http://www.benbest.com/nutrceut/CoEnzymeQ.html).</description>

./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Geranyl diphosphate is the precursor of monoterpenes, a large family of natural occurring C10 compounds predominately found in plants and animals. Geranyl diphosphate is regarded as a key intermediate in the steroid, isoprene and terpene biosynthesis pathways and is used by organisms in the biosynthesis of farnesyl pyrophosphate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, cholesterol, terpenes and terpenoids. (wikipedia). In humans, geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) catalyzes the condensation of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to form geranyl diphosphate. Animals produce IPP through the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Isoprenoid compounds have been implicated in several human disease states including coronary heart disease, blindness, infectious hepatitis and cancer.

./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Ubiquinone-1 is a member of the chemical class known as Polyprenylbenzoquinones. These are compounds containing a polyisoprene chain attached to a quinone at the second ring position. Ubiquione-1 has just 1 isoprene unit. Normally in humans it has 10. Ubiquinone-1 is an intermediate in the synthesis of Ubiquionone 10, which is also called Coenzyme Q (CoQ). CoQ is found in the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, lysosomes, vesicles and notably the inner membrane of the mitochondrion where it is an important part of the electron transport chain; there it passes reducing equivalents to acceptors such as Coenzyme Q : cytochrome c - oxidoreductase. CoQ is also essential in the formation of the apoptosome along with other adapter proteins. The loss of trophic factors activates pro-apoptotic enzymes, causing the breakdown of mitochondria. Because of its ability to transfer electrons and therefore act as an antioxidant, Coenzyme Q has become a valued dietary supplement. CoQ10 has been widely used for the treatment of heart disease (especially heart failure), gum diseases, and also breast cancer. The benzoquinone portion of Coenzyme Q10 is synthesized from amino acids, while the isoprene sidechain is synthesized from acetyl CoA through the mevalonate pathway. The mevalonate pathway is used for the first steps of cholesterol biosynthesis.</description>

Vitamin K is a family of phylloquinones that contains a ring of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone and an isoprenoid side chain. Several forms of vitamin K have been identified: vitamin K 1 (vitamin K 1) derived from plants, vitamin K 2 (menaquinone) from bacteria, and synthetic naphthoquinone provitamins, vitamin K 3 (menadione). Vitamin K1 has only one double bond on the proximal isoprene unit. Vitamin K1 possesses the same type and degree of activity as does naturally-occurring vitamin K, which is necessary for the production via the liver of active prothrombin (factor II), proconvertin (factor VII), plasma thromboplastin component (factor IX), and Stuart factor (factor X). Rich sources of vitamin K 1 include green plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria. Vitamin K1 has antihemorrhagic and prothrombogenic activity. Vitamin K1 is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stable to air and moisture but decomposes in sunlight. It is found naturally in a wide variety of green plants.</description>

./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Farnesol is a signaling molecule that is derived from farnesyl diphosphate, an intermediate in the isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Farnesol is a 15 carbon isoprenoid alcohol is the corresponding dephosphorylated form of the isoprenoid farnesyl diphosphate. Farnesol has a potential role in controlling the degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase (EC 1.1.1.34, NADPH-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase). The enzyme is stabilized under conditions of cellular sterol depletion (e.g. statin-treated cells) and rapidly degraded in sterol-loaded cells. In mammalian cells, this enhanced degradation is dependent on the presence of both a sterol and a non-sterol derived from the isoprenoid pathway; farnesol, the dephosphorylated form of farnesyl diphosphate, can function as the non-sterol component. Farnesol has been shown to activate the farnesoid receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor that forms a functional heterodimer with RXR. Thus, dephosphorylation of farnesyl diphosphate, an intermediate in the cholesterol synthetic pathway, might produce an active ligand for the FXR:RXR heterodimer. The physiological ligand for FXR remains to be identified; farnesol, may simply mimic the unidentified natural ligand(s). In addition, exogenous farnesol have an effect on several other physiological processes, including inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell cycle progression and actin cytoskeletal disorganization. Farnesol cellular availability is an important determinant of vascular tone in animals and humans, and provides a basis for exploring farnesyl metabolism in humans with compromised vascular function as well as for using farnesyl analogues as regulators of arterial tone in vivo. A possible metabolic fate for farnesol is its conversion to farnesoic acid, and then to farnesol-derived dicarboxylic acids (FDDCAs) which would then be excreted in the urine. Farnesol can also be oxidized to a prenyl aldehyde, presumably by an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and that this activity resides in the mitochondrial and peroxisomal. Liver Endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomal fractions are able to phosphorylate farnesol to Farnesyl diphosphate in a Cytosine triphosphate dependent fashion. (PMID: 9812197, 8636420, 9083051, 9015362). Prenol is polymerized by dehydration reactions; when there are at least four isoprene units (n in the above formula is greater than or equal to four), the polymer is called a polyprenol. Polyprenols can contain up to 100 isoprene units (n=100) linked end to end with the hydroxyl group (-OH) remaining at the end. These isoprenoid alcohols are also called terpenols These isoprenoid alcohols are important in the acylation of proteins, carotenoids, and fat-soluble vitamins A, E and K. They are also building blocks for plant oils such as farnesol and geraniol. Prenol is also a building block of cholesterol (built from six isoprene units), and thus of all steroids. Prenol has sedative properities, it is probably GABA receptor allosteric modulator.When the isoprene unit attached to the alcohol is saturated, the compound is referred to as a dolichol. Dolichols are important as glycosyl carriers in the synthesis of polysaccharides.(Wikipedia).</description>

./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Triterpenoid is a byproduct from squalene 2,3-oxide decomposition. Squalene is a precursor to sterol biosynthesis. Terpenes are derived biosynthetically from units of isoprene, which has the molecular formula C5H8. The basic molecular formulas of terpenes are multiples of that, (C5H8)n where n is the number of linked isoprene units. This is called the isoprene rule or the C5 rule. The isoprene units may be linked together "head to tail" to form linear chains or they may can be arranged to form rings.

./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Dolichols are polyisoprenic molecule ubiquitously present in the lipid fraction of animal and plant tissues, discovered 40 years ago during experiments on the biosynthesis of ubiquinone. The molecular structure of dolichol comprises a sequence of unsaturated isoprenic units bearing a primary terminal hydroxyl group. The length of dolichyl chains depends on the species of the organism from which they are isolated. Mammalian dolichol generally is made up of 16 to 23 unsaturated isoprene units, and the terminal hydroxyl group may exist either free or esterified with fatty acids, phosphoric acid, and pyrophosphoric acid. In biological membranes, this linear polyisoprenoid compound may be located between the two leaflets of the lipid bilayer, close to the free end of the phospholipid fatty acid molecules. Metabolism and function of dolichol were largely unknown until recently. Synthesis of dolichol by the mevalonate pathway was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in many tissues. The isoprenoid pyrophosphate intermediates are shared by the cholesterol, dolichol, and ubiquinone pathways, and treatment with drugs that block hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase may significantly decrease their plasma and tissue levels. In humans, there is no apparent positive correlation between serum dolichol and tissue dolichol and age. In view of the total content of the body, half life of the total body dolichol, and dolichol content in the extracellular space, it was concluded that the dolichol in tissues probably derives from biosynthesis in those tissues and that relocation of dolichol via circulation cannot be prominent in vivo. The levels of dolichol in human serum have apparently no correlation to age or serum total cholesterol, and exhibit a linear correlation to high density lipoprotein cholesterols which may reflect the fact that the dolichols are associated with the high-density lipoprotein fraction. No enzymic pathways for dolichol degradation were described, but no case of dolichol-storage disease was reported. Shrinkage of tissue because of increased lysosomal degradation in the process of atrophy does not affect the dolichol content and concentration increases. Small quantities of dolichol that may be excreted into the urine at least in part is derived from the lysosomes of the excretory organ, and serum dolichol levels may be elevated in chronic cholestatic liver diseases. Recent evidence shows that phagocytosis may cause the degradation and disposal of the engulfed dolichol, possibly because of nonenzymatic free radical mediated decomposition. By means of a 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analytical method, the hypothesis was substantiated that dolichol may act as a free-radical scavenger in the cell membranes and protect polyunsaturated fatty acids from peroxidation, and that it may undergo decomposition in the process.

./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Dolichol phosphate is the most prevalent polyisoprenyl-glycosyl carrier found in mammals. It is involved in reactions such as the C-4 and O-mannosylation of proteins, the formation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors and the N-glycosylation of proteins. The chain length of eukaryotic dolichol molecules differs from 14 to 17 isoprene units in unicellular organisms like yeast whereas mammalian cells produce dolichol with 18-21 isoprene units. During the de novo synthesis of dolichol in eukaryotes, farnesyl pyrophosphate, a metabolite of cholesterol biosynthesis, is elongated by successive condensations to isopentenyl pyrophosphate molecules. These reactions are catalyzed by cis-isopentenyltransferases. After the polyisoprene pyrophosphate chain has reached its final length, both phosphate residues are released by mono- or pyrophosphatases. The isoprene unit of the polyprenol is then reduced by a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent microsomal reductase. The final step in dolichol phosphate synthesis is catalyzed by dolichol kinase (DK1), an enzyme that transfers a phosphate from choline-phosphate cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to dolichol. Once synthesized, dolichol phosphate can react with cytosolic GDP-mannose in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form dolichyl phosphate D-mannose. A new inherited metabolic disorder, Dolichol kinase (DK1) deficiency has recently been discovered. Affected patients present with a very severe clinical phenotype, with death in early infancy. Symptoms include secondary microencephaly, dry, thin, parchmentlike skin, hyperkeratosis, minimal hair growth and muscular hypotonia. (PMID: 17273964).</description>

./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Ubiquinone-2 is a member of the chemical class known as Polyprenylbenzoquinones. These are compounds containing a polyisoprene chain attached to a quinone at the second ring position. Ubiquione-2 has just 2 isoprene units. Normally in humans it has 10. Ubiquinone-2 is an intermediate in the synthesis of Ubiquionone 10. Ubiquionone is involved in cellular respiration. It is fat-soluble and is therefore mobile in cellular membranes; it plays a unique role in the electron transport chain (ETC). In the inner bacterial membrane, electrons from NADH and succinate pass through the ETC to the oxygen, which is then reduced to water. The transfer of electrons through ETC results in the pumping of H+ across the membrane creating a proton gradient across the membrane, which is used by ATP synthase (located on the membrane) to generate ATP.</description>
./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Ubiquinone-4 is a member of the chemical class known as Polyprenylbenzoquinones. These are compounds containing a polyisoprene chain attached to a quinone at the second ring position. Ubiquione-4 has just 4 isoprene units. Normally in humans it has 10 (CoQ10). Ubiquinone-4 is an intermediate in the synthesis of Ubiquionone 10. Ubiquinone-4 is a Coenzyme Q analogue that have been identified in brain. Based on the isoprenoid moiety, the presence of various coenzyme Q homologues in prokaryotes and eurkaryotes has been confirmed, and these homologues are classified as Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11, and Q12. The numbers, Qn, refer to the number of isoprenoid units attached at the 6- position on the benzoquinone ring of the coenzyme Q moiety. (PMID: 12064350) Coenzyme Q is the only type of Quinone naturally found in animals (other quinones such as vitamin K is provided by foods). Coenzyme Q is a fat-soluble and amphipathic compound that is the integral component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. It is ubiquitous in nature and is found in subcellular organelles, serum lipoproteins, blood plasma, urine, and feces. Ubiquinones are amphipathic because of the benzoquinone ring (hydrophilic) and the polyisoprenoid side chain moiety (lipophilic). The primary role of coenzyme Q is to transfer electrons between redox components of the electron transport chain, to create a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and drive ATP formation. Additional functions of coenzyme Q are to influence membrane fluidity; to recycle the radical forms of vitamin C and E; and, most important, to act as a lipid antioxidant protecting membrane phospholipids against peroxidation. Coenzyme Q is the only endogenously occurring lipid-soluble antioxidant that occurs ubiquitously and can be synthesized in all organisms.</description>

./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Geranylgeranylcysteine is a modified thioether amino acid in which an isoprenyl group (geranylgeranyl) has been attached to the sulfhydryl group of cysteine through a thioether bond. Geranylgeranylcysteine is typically formed through posttranslational (prenylation) protein modification whereupon degradation of the parent protein leaves the modified (prenylated) amino acid. Prenylation is a relatively recently discovered post-translational modification of proteins that directs cytosollic proteins to membranes while at the same time activating them functionally. The change in hydrophobicity that is essential for membrane binding is done via the covalent attachment of a polyisoprene (such as a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl group) to a C-terminal cysteine by a thioether bond. Prenylated proteins can comprise up to 2% of total cellular protein. Prenylcysteine lyase is an enzyme that is capable of cleaving the thiother bond in prenylcysteines and is used to help in the turnover of prenylated proteins. Prenylcysteine lyase deficiency leads to the accumulation of farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine in brain and liver. (PMID: 9287348).</description>

./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Nateglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naive to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Nateglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine (83%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites possess less activity than the parent compound. One minor metabolite, the isoprene, has the same potency as its parent compound. </description>

./hmdb_metabolites.xml:  <description>Ubiquinone-6 is a member of the chemical class known as Polyprenylbenzoquinones. These are compounds containing a polyisoprene chain attached to a quinone at the second ring position. Ubiquione-6 has just 6 isoprene units. Normally in humans it has 10. Ubiquinone-6 is an intermediate in the synthesis of Ubiquionone 10. It is an endogenouse compound but it has also been isolated from foods containing baker's yeast. Ubiquionone 10 (CoQ10) is involved in cellular respiration. It is fat-soluble and is therefore mobile in cellular membranes; it plays a unique role in the electron transport chain (ETC). In the inner bacterial membrane, electrons from NADH and succinate pass through the ETC to the oxygen, which is then reduced to water. The transfer of electrons through ETC results in the pumping of H+ across the membrane creating a proton gradient across the membrane, which is used by ATP synthase (located on the membrane) to generate ATP.</description>
